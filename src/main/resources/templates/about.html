    <h2>About Our Project</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Welcome to our competency checker platform! This project is a part of our initiatives to utilize advanced technology in assessing the potential and competency of individuals in the field of programming and development.</p>

        <p>Our platform works by presenting users with a set of problems or tasks in different programming related categories. As the user provides their solutions or answers, our system forwards these responses to an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) model.</p>

        <p>The AI is built with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and has been trained on a wide range of correct and incorrect programming solutions. This allows it to effectively rate the user's answers in terms of correctness, efficiency, and even coding style.</p>

        <p>Upon completion of the tests, the AI generates a comprehensive summary of the user's performance, identifying their strengths and areas for improvement. This serves as a valuable tool for users to understand their competency level and progress in their learning journey.</p>

        <p>This project, being part of our Curriculum Vitae (CV), demonstrates our ability to integrate and apply complex technologies in practical, user-centric applications. We hope it provides users with valuable insight into their programming skills and aids in their personal and professional development.</p>
